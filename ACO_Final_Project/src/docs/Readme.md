---
---
# **Here’s a step-by-step dry run of your code (main.cpp, ACO, and Randoms):**
---
---

### 1. Program Start

- `main()` is called.
- An `ACO` object is created with 4 ants, 8 cities, and the specified parameters.

---

### 2. Initialization

- `ANTS->init()` allocates memory for the graph, city positions, pheromones, routes, etc.
- All arrays are initialized to default values.

---

### 3. Graph Construction

- `connectCITIES` is called multiple times to connect cities in the graph and initialize pheromone values randomly.
- `setCITYPOSITION` sets the (x, y) coordinates for each city.

---

### 4. Print Graph and Pheromones

- `printGRAPH()` outputs the adjacency matrix of the cities.
- `printPHEROMONES()` outputs the initial pheromone levels between connected cities.

---

### 5. Optimization Loop

- `optimize(ITERATIONS)` runs for 5 iterations:
  - For each ant:
    - The ant is released and attempts to build a valid route.
    - If the route is invalid (duplicate cities, disconnected, etc.), the ant is reset and tries again.
    - Once a valid route is found, its length is calculated.
    - If this route is the best so far, it is saved as the best route.
  - After all ants finish, pheromones are updated based on the routes found.
  - All ant routes are reset for the next iteration.

---

### 6. Print Results

- `printRESULTS()` prints the best route found and its length, as well as the ideal route (hardcoded).

---

### 7. Program End

- The program returns 0.
- The destructor for `ACO` is called, freeing all allocated memory.

---

## Key Points

- The code will print the graph, initial pheromones, and the best route found after 5 iterations.
- The random number generator is used for pheromone initialization and route selection.
- The code is now safe from memory leaks and out-of-bounds errors after the previous fixes.

---
---
## ** Here’s a dry run of your Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) code for all iterations, focusing on the main loop in main.cpp and the optimize method:**
---
---

## Initialization

- An ACO object is created with 4 ants and 8 cities.
- Arrays for the graph, city positions, pheromones, routes, etc., are allocated and initialized.
- Cities are connected as per the problem graph.
- City positions are set.

---

## Before Iterations

- The graph and initial pheromone matrix are printed.

---

## Optimization Loop (5 Iterations)

For each iteration (1 to 5):

### For Each Ant (0 to 3):

1. **Route Construction:**
  - The ant starts at the initial city (0).
  - For each step, it selects the next city probabilistically, based on pheromone and distance (using PHI and PROBS).
  - If the ant creates an invalid route (duplicate cities, disconnected, etc.), it is reset and tries again.

2. **Route Validation:**
  - The route is checked for validity (no duplicates, all connections exist, etc.).

3. **Route Length Calculation:**
  - The total length of the route is calculated.

4. **Best Route Update:**
  - If this route is shorter than the current best, it becomes the new best route.

5. **Route Output:**
  - The route for the ant is printed.

### After All Ants:

6. **Pheromone Update:**
  - Pheromones are updated based on the quality of the routes found (better routes deposit more pheromone).
  - Pheromone evaporation is applied.

7. **Reset Ant Routes:**
  - All ant routes are reset for the next iteration.

8. **Pheromone Matrix Output:**
  - The updated pheromone matrix is printed.

---

## After All Iterations

- The best route found and its length are printed.
- The ideal route and its length are printed for comparison.

---

## What You’ll See in Output

- For each iteration:
  - Each ant’s route and its length.
  - Pheromone matrix after update.
- At the end:
  - The best route found and its length.
  - The ideal route and its length.

---

## Notes

- The actual routes and lengths will vary due to the random nature of the algorithm.
- The best route may improve over iterations as pheromones guide the ants toward better solutions.

If you want a step-by-step trace for a specific iteration or ant, or want to see the actual output, let me know!

## How to run it

 - To run your C++ project on Windows, follow these steps:

1. **Open Command Prompt** and navigate to your project directory:
```sh
cd /d d:\dummy\aco-master\src
```

2. **Compile the code** using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ from MinGW or MSYS2):
```sh
g++ -o aco.exe main.cpp ACO.cpp Randoms.cpp
```

3. **Run the compiled program:**
```sh
./aco.exe
```

**Note:**
- If you don't have g++ installed, you can install MinGW or MSYS2, or use Visual Studio's Developer Command Prompt and replace `g++` with `cl`.
- Make sure all your `.cpp` files are in the same directory or provide the correct paths.
## Certainly! Here’s a simple explanation of your output:

---

### 1. **GRAPH and PHEROMONES**
- The program prints the connections between cities (the graph) and the initial pheromone levels on each path.

### 2. **Iterations**
- The program runs **5 iterations**.
- In each iteration, **4 ants** try to find a route that visits all cities.

### 3. **Ants' Behavior**
- Each ant starts at city 0 and tries to build a valid route.
- If an ant makes a mistake (like revisiting a city or hitting a dead end), it is "released again" (restarts its attempt).
- When an ant completes a valid route, it prints the route (e.g., `0 2 6 7 4 5 1 3`).

### 4. **Pheromone Update**
- After all ants finish, the pheromone levels on the paths are updated.
- Paths used in better (shorter) routes get more pheromone, making them more attractive for the next iteration.

### 5. **Best Route**
- After all iterations, the program prints the **best route found** and its length.
- In your output, the best route is `0 7 6 2 4 5 1 3` with a length of `127.509`.
- This matches the "IDEAL ROUTE" (the known best solution for this problem).

---

**Summary:**  
Your program simulates ants searching for the shortest path through all cities. Over several iterations, the ants learn (via pheromones) to prefer better routes. In the end, they find the optimal route.
